## My Progress Journal

I'm Ferdi Atesin and maths teacher in IELEV school. I have been working over 13 years in various schools and last 5 years of them as IB Teacher. Statistics and Computer Science lectures have become more essential topics in the new curriculum of IB which will be starting in 2019. With following all the renewned curriculums throughout the world, IBO (International Baccalaureate Organization) changes the math and computer science curriculum in every seven years. New Exams will take place at the first time in 2021. 

In the new syllabus, data science will occur more important topic in both subject Mathematics and Computer Science. I would like to integrate big data with my knowledge in Maths in order to clarify some Internal Explorations and Extended Essays which students will have to do in IB.

My ultimate goal in life is able to work as a teacher in anywhere around the world.
